# -Customer-Purchase-Prediction-Model
Developed a classification model to identify whether an existing customer will purchase a new car for an Automotive Dealer

The goal of this project is to develop the best binary classification model that predicts
whether an existing customer is more likely to buy a new car and use the results of the
model to target leads for a marketing campaign. By predicting which customers are more
likely to buy a new car, the business can focus its marketing efforts on those customers who
are most likely to make a purchase with personalized marketing messages and offers. This
can help to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the marketing campaign, leading to
higher sales and revenue. On the other hand, inaccurate results can lead to wasted
marketing resources and a lower return on investment.

The given sample dataset contains information on various attributes of customers, which will
be used to train and test the model, and the performance of the model will be evaluated
using appropriate metrics such as accuracy score, f1 score and confusion matrix. By using
different algorithms and combinations of hyperparameters, we can test the impact of these
parameters on the model's performance and determine which ones are the most important.

The dataset has 131337 rows and 17 columns. Based on the summary of the dataset, there
are 2 columns with missing values that need further exploration and cleaning: “age_band”
and “gender”. Additionally, there are four categorical variables named “age_band”, “gender”,
“car_model” and “car_segment” that need to be transformed into numerical variables in order
to be fit into the classification model. Based on the descriptive statistics, all other numerical
variables have values ranging from 1 to 10, which will not require us to scale the values as
the range is not large.
